    <H2>some random day at Ramdeobaba University</H2>
    <p>Today I attended a lecture on "Indian Geopolitics and Different types of warefares". It was quite fascinating. I learned a lot about the history of our subcontinent , ideological and religious conflicts as well as different types of warefares and indian stance on china, USA diplomacy.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I woke up early in the morning , probably at 3 am. I Started my day with a cup of tea and creatine. I then followed up some push-ups and situps and later ran 2 miles. After my running session I came home and took a bath, then I played my guitar and listened some music after that. Later I had my breakfast and drop my brother to his school. Then I studied the concept of Database Management System and also got readied for school, Left home around 1000 hrs. Reached ramdeo tekdi at around 1030 hrs. Entered the classroom like commandos bash inside a hostage building in call of duty. Enjoyed with buddies and eat some snacks from vending machine. </p>
    <p>then there came the break, In break we generally study DSA and it's leetcode problems. I enjoy that session really very much as It makes me feel I am very productive</p>
